The frontend requires caching of backend queries using RTQ, while the backend inventory service may scale
differently based on cluster HPA rules. Infrastructure failures may affect frontend user experience if not isolated
using service mesh timeouts. Compliance also mandates audit logs exposed partly via the frontend admin panels
but enforced through backend IAM.
