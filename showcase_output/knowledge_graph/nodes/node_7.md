Global state uses a hybrid model:

- Business state → Redux Toolkit
- Remote server state → Redux Toolkit Query
- Ephemeral UI state → Recoil
- Cross-tab sync → BroadcastChannel API

Guidelines include:

- No direct fetch calls inside components  
- All server interactions via unified "Service Hooks"  
- UI mutation goes through RTL reducers or Recoil atoms
