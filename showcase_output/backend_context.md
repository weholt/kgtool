---

The Acme Unified Operations Platform (UOP) is designed to support enterprise-scale workflows involving
real-time data ingestion, multi-tenant resource partitioning, analytics processing, and domain-specific client
applications including web, desktop, and field-service apps.

The purpose of this document is to provide end-to-end architectural guidance for engineering teams:
frontend, backend, data engineering, SRE/DevOps, security analysts, QA, and support teams.

The SPA is bootstrapped with Vite and uses:

- React 18
- React Router v6
- Redux Toolkit Query
- Framer Motion animation layer
- TailwindCSS + internal DLS tokens (variables, semantic colors, spacing presets)
- Integration with Webpack Module Federation runtime for plugin injection

Key deliverables for frontend teams:

- Reusable primitive components  
- Page-level layouts  
- Full accessibility coverage (WCAG 2.2 AA)  
- SSR-compatible fetch layer  
- Client-side error boundary strategy

## [31] 10. Cross-domain mixed content (for testing classification)

**Tags:** backend

**Keywords:** backend, frontend, using, service, based cluster, failures, exposed partly, experience isolated

**Keyphrases:** cluster HPA rules, scale differently based, HPA rules, queries using RTQ, cluster HPA, frontend requires caching, requires caching, scale differently, differently based, based on cluster

---

The frontend requires caching of backend queries using RTQ, while the backend inventory service may scale
differently based on cluster HPA rules. Infrastructure failures may affect frontend user experience if not isolated
using service mesh timeouts. Compliance also mandates audit logs exposed partly via the frontend admin panels
but enforced through backend IAM.
