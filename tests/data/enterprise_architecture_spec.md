# Enterprise System Architecture Specification  
Version 4.7 – Internal Use Only  
Author: Acme Systems Group  
Date: 2025-01-22

## 1. Executive Overview

The Acme Unified Operations Platform (UOP) is designed to support enterprise-scale workflows involving
real-time data ingestion, multi-tenant resource partitioning, analytics processing, and domain-specific client
applications including web, desktop, and field-service apps.

The purpose of this document is to provide end-to-end architectural guidance for engineering teams:
frontend, backend, data engineering, SRE/DevOps, security analysts, QA, and support teams.

### Key objectives

- Modern, modular architecture
- Efficiency at scale (100k+ DAU)
- UI consistency across channels
- Strong domain integrity
- Federated dev teams with shared standards

## 2. System Domains

The platform includes five major semi-independent domains:

1. **Frontend Delivery Layer**  
   - React SPA  
   - Native Desktop Shell  
   - Mobile companion app (React Native)  
   - Shared Design Language System (DLS)

2. **Application Services Layer (Backend Microservices)**  
   - Identity & Access  
   - Resource Scheduling  
   - Inventory Tracking  
   - Document Processing  
   - Analytics Pipeline  
   - Notification Hub

3. **Data Management Layer**  
   - OLTP DB (PostgreSQL)  
   - Caching (Redis)  
   - Data Lake (S3)  
   - OLAP Data Warehouse  
   - Event Stream (Kafka)

4. **Infrastructure Layer (Cloud + Kubernetes)**  
   - Multi-region cluster  
   - Service mesh (Istio)  
   - Zero-trust network segments  
   - Autoscaling policies  
   - Observability stack

5. **Security & Compliance Layer**  
   - IAM Policies  
   - SIEM Integration  
   - Audit Logs  
   - Key Management  
   - Compliance mapping (SOC2, ISO)

## 3. User Interface (Frontend)

### 3.1 Application Shell

The SPA is bootstrapped with Vite and uses:

- React 18
- React Router v6
- Redux Toolkit Query
- Framer Motion animation layer
- TailwindCSS + internal DLS tokens (variables, semantic colors, spacing presets)
- Integration with Webpack Module Federation runtime for plugin injection

Key deliverables for frontend teams:

- Reusable primitive components  
- Page-level layouts  
- Full accessibility coverage (WCAG 2.2 AA)  
- SSR-compatible fetch layer  
- Client-side error boundary strategy  

### 3.2 Component Categories

| Category | Examples |
|---------|----------|
| Primitives | Button, Link, Badge, Stack, Surface |
| Data Inputs | Select, MultiSelect, DatePicker, FileUpload |
| Complex | DataGrid, Scheduler, ResourceTimeline |
| Visualization | DonutChart, LineSeries, Heatmap |

### 3.3 State Management

Global state uses a hybrid model:

- Business state → Redux Toolkit
- Remote server state → Redux Toolkit Query
- Ephemeral UI state → Recoil
- Cross-tab sync → BroadcastChannel API

Guidelines include:

- No direct fetch calls inside components  
- All server interactions via unified "Service Hooks"  
- UI mutation goes through RTL reducers or Recoil atoms  

### 3.4 Frontend Security

Frontend must:

- Never store tokens in localStorage  
- Use `Authorization: Bearer` + memory-only tokens  
- Require re-authentication after idle timeout  
- Reject untrusted HTML  
- Enforce strict CSP  
- Validate user permissions client-side (UI gating), but never rely solely on it

## 4. Backend Services

### 4.1 Common Principles

- Each service independently deployable  
- Public contracts via versioned OpenAPI  
- Immutable event logs  
- Outbox pattern for reliable delivery  
- CI/CD-driven migrations  
- Rate limiting per client and tenant  

### 4.2 Identity Service

- OAuth2 Authorization Code  
- JWT RS512 with key rotation  
- Password policy rules configurable per tenant  
- Webhooks for login events  
- SAML 2.0 compatibility  

### 4.3 Inventory Service

Manages:

- Assets  
- Warehouse locations  
- Inventory deltas  
- Supplier relationships  

Patterns:

- Domain-driven aggregates  
- Event-sourced asset movements  
- Async reconciliation jobs  

### 4.4 Document Processing Service

Supports:

- PDF extraction  
- Image OCR  
- Classification  
- Retention policy enforcement  

Dependencies:

- S3 (raw documents)  
- Redis (work queue)  
- OCR Engine (Tesseract cluster)  

### 4.5 Notification Hub

Supports:

- Email (SMTP)  
- SMS (provider pool)  
- Mobile push notifications  
- Web push  
- Delivery logs + analytics

## 5. Data Engineering

### 5.1 Data Lake

- Raw tables partitioned by ingestion date  
- Parquet format  
- Automatic schema evolution  
- Late-arriving data handling  

### 5.2 ETL / ELT

- Orchestration on Airflow  
- Spark jobs for transformation  
- Materialized OLAP tables in columnar warehouse  
- Data quality tests via Great Expectations  

### 5.3 Real-time Stream Processing

Uses Kafka → Flink for:

- Metrics aggregation  
- Anomaly detection  
- Alert triggering  
- Change propagation to search index (Elasticsearch cluster)

## 6. Infrastructure

### 6.1 Kubernetes

- Multi-zone  
- Node pools: general, compute-optimized, memory-optimized  
- Pod disruption budgets  
- Cluster autoscaler integration  

### 6.2 Networking

- Istio mutual TLS  
- Internal-only egress for sensitive workloads  
- Gateway API instead of Ingress for new services  

### 6.3 Observability

- OpenTelemetry instrumentation  
- Loki for logs  
- Tempo for traces  
- Prometheus remote-write

## 7. Compliance, Governance & Security

### 7.1 Zero-Trust

All traffic authenticated + encrypted inside cluster.

### 7.2 Key Management

Keys stored in HSM-backed vault.

### 7.3 Audit Trail

Immutable append-only logs, exposed to admins via UI.

---

## 8. Workflows

### 8.1 Resource Scheduling Workflow

1. Frontend user selects resources on timeline.  
2. SPA sends POST `/api/v2/schedule/apply`.  
3. Backend validates business rules.  
4. Scheduler engine updates aggregates.  
5. Kafka event `ScheduleApplied` emitted.  
6. Analytics pipeline consumes event.  

### 8.2 Document Upload Workflow

1. User uploads via DropZone.  
2. SPA sends file to Upload API.  
3. Storage service streams file to S3.  
4. OCR is scheduled.  
5. Classification runs.  
6. Document indexed in search.  
7. Audit log entry emitted.

## 9. Glossary

- **UOP** – Unified Operations Platform  
- **RTQ** – Remote Task Queue  
- **HPA** – Horizontal Pod Autoscaler  

---

## 10. Cross-domain mixed content (for testing classification)

The frontend requires caching of backend queries using RTQ, while the backend inventory service may scale
differently based on cluster HPA rules. Infrastructure failures may affect frontend user experience if not isolated
using service mesh timeouts. Compliance also mandates audit logs exposed partly via the frontend admin panels
but enforced through backend IAM.
